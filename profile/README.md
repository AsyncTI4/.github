# AsyncTI4

AsyncTI4 started out as a small group of people playing TI4 asynchronously on BoardGameGeek forums (PBF - play by forum), with map updates handled through GIMP images. This Discord server was originally just a method to ping players for their turns on BGG faster.

PBD1 was born when a small group decided to try and play a game without needing a moderator to manage game state amd decks. It started out with using Dicecord to manage decks, TTS screenshots to manage map state, and a channel to keep public player area stuff updated as text blocks.

**The Botfather** [@TerTerro](https://github.com/TerTerro) grew tired of waiting for TTS map screenshots to be updated and set off to develop a bot to handle various game mechanics. After a few weeks, the bot was up and running. With [@somno](https://github.com/CptSomno) handling all the graphics art, and [@HolyTispoon](https://github.com/HolyTispoon) ~~nagging~~ interfacing with the community and providing direction on what to work on, the bot reached 100% able to run and display a full game of TI4 in roughly 4 months.
