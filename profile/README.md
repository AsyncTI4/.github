# AsyncTI4

AsyncTI4 started out as a small group of people playing TI4 asynchronously on BoardGameGeek forums (PBF - play by forum), with map updates handled through TTS/TTPG screenshots.

**The Botfather** [@TerTerro](https://github.com/TerTerro) grew tired of waiting for map screenshots to be updated and set off to develop a bot to handle various game mechanics. After a few weeks, the bot was up and running. With [@somno](https://github.com/CptSomno) handling all the graphics art, and [@HolyTispoon](https://github.com/HolyTispoon) ~~nagging~~ interfacing with the community and providing direction on what to work on, the bot reached 100% able to run and display a full game of TI4.
